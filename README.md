# ATAK Imagery

Cross-platform ATAK imagery pipeline with simple one-click install.

## Linux: run `install_linux.sh` first

On Linux, **always run the installer before using the apps**. The file **`install_linux.sh`** in the **project root** (same folder as `README.md`) prepares **both** programs—**ATAK Device Installer** and **ATAK Imagery Downloader**—and the Python environment they rely on. Skipping it and running the `.py` files by hand will usually fail or miss dependencies.

Source repository: `https://github.com/atakmaps/atak-imagery`

### How to run the installer

1. Put the project on your machine and open a **terminal**:
   - **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/atakmaps/atak-imagery.git` then `cd atak-imagery`
   - **Linux install zip:** under [Releases](https://github.com/atakmaps/atak-imagery/releases), download **`atak-imagery-v*-linux-install.zip`** for your version from **Assets** (not the auto-generated “Source code (zip)”, which uses a different folder layout). The **Assets** zip stores every file under a root directory **`atak-imagery/`** inside the archive.

     Run `unzip` in the **same directory as the `.zip` file** (a **parent** folder—usually `Downloads`). That directory will gain a **`atak-imagery`** folder next to the zip:

     ```bash
     cd ~/Downloads
     unzip atak-imagery-v1.1.0-linux-install.zip
     ls atak-imagery/install_linux.sh
     cd atak-imagery
     chmod +x install_linux.sh
     ./install_linux.sh
     ```

     If `ls` does not show `install_linux.sh` under `atak-imagery/`, you may have unzipped from **inside** an empty `atak-imagery` you created first (that nests a second `atak-imagery`). Remove that folder, stay in the parent directory (e.g. `Downloads`), and run `unzip` again. Use the real zip filename if you downloaded a different release.

     The script may ask for **`sudo`** for system packages. Some file managers can run `install_linux.sh` with a double-click; if nothing happens, use the terminal block above.

2. If you **cloned** instead of using the zip, run the installer from the repo root:

   ```bash
   cd atak-imagery
   chmod +x install_linux.sh
   ./install_linux.sh
   ```

### What `install_linux.sh` does

The root script runs **`scripts/install_linux.sh`**, which:

- Installs or checks **system packages** needed for the pipeline (Python 3, pip/venv, Tkinter, Zenity, Android **adb**, etc.) via apt, dnf, or pacman when it recognizes your distro.
- Creates or repairs a **virtual environment** at **`.venv/`** and installs Python dependencies from **`requirements.txt`**.
- Copies **`deploy.env.example`** to **`deploy.env`** the first time, so **ATAK Device Installer** has a config template to edit.
- Writes **`run_atak_pipeline_with_device.sh`** and **`run_atak_pipeline.sh`** in the project root (wrappers that call the correct Python entry points with that venv).
- Installs **two desktop shortcuts** (under `~/.local/share/applications/` and on `~/Desktop` when it exists):
  - **ATAK Device Installer** — USB setup: install ATAK and your plugin on the phone, then continue into the map workflow.
  - **ATAK Imagery Downloader** — download imagery and build packages when the device is already configured.

After a successful run, use those desktop entries or the two shell scripts above. You only need to run **`install_linux.sh`** again if you move the tree, recreate the venv, or need to refresh system/Python dependencies.

## Current stable release (Linux / source)

**Linux / source release:** `v1.1.0` (tag **`v1.1.0`** on GitHub).

**Windows:** A new Windows packaged build is **not** included in this cycle. **Use Windows release `2.8`** until a newer Windows installer is published. Source copies under `windows_build/` include the same startup behaviors when run with Python.

Version **1.1** highlights:

- **Screen-aware Tk windows** (`scripts/tk_window_scaling.py`): main dialogs scale to fit small laptops and grow modestly on large displays (Device Installer, Imagery Downloader, SQLite builder, DTED downloader — Linux and `windows_build` copies).
- **Optional in-app update check** (`scripts/git_update_check.py`): when running from a **git clone** (not a frozen EXE or zip-only tree), **ATAK Device Installer** and **ATAK Imagery Downloader** fetch `origin/main` in the background; after ~2s a “Checking for updates…” progress window may appear. If `main` has new commits, you get a dialog listing recent change subjects and may choose to **stash (if needed), checkout `main`, `git pull --ff-only`, and restart** the same entrypoint.
- **Linux install zip on Releases:** download **`atak-imagery-v*-linux-install.zip`** from GitHub Assets (full tree under `atak-imagery/` for `install_linux.sh`; built with `python3 scripts/build_release.py`).
- *(Prior v1.0.x behavior retained: DC handling, DTED push paths, `deploy.env.example`, tile plan cache tooling, etc.)*

**Auto-update requirements:** **Git** on `PATH`, network to `origin`, and a clone with `origin` pointing at this repository. Release zips and PyInstaller bundles without `.git` skip the check silently.

**Maintainer note (Windows / PyInstaller):** When packaging with a `.spec` that lists hidden imports explicitly, include **`tk_window_scaling`** and **`git_update_check`**.

### Previous release (v1.0.0)

- **ATAK Device Installer**: production wizard only (debug skip controls removed); post-plugin instructions including device **OK** for plugin install; **Continue** before launching the imagery downloader
- **ATAK Imagery Downloader**: same SQLite handoff dialog when launched from the installer as in standalone; blocks **District of Columbia** as the only state selection, with an explanation; clearer errors when no states remain to download
- **DTED step**: pushes per-state `ATAK_SQL*.sqlite` file(s) and the DTED zip to the device under `/sdcard/atak/imagery` and `/sdcard/atak/DTED` (override with `ATAK_DEVICE_FILES_ROOT`); post-build **Yes/No** raw-imagery cleanup; adb restart of ATAK and completion dialog
- **Installer**: `deploy.env.example` seed; portable root paths in root launchers

## Overview

This project provides a streamlined pipeline for:

- imagery download
- SQLite creation for ATAK imagery packages
- DTED package download
- final ATAK-ready output packaging

Primary Linux/source scripts:

- `scripts/atak_downloader_finalbuild.py` — standalone Imagery Downloader
- `scripts/atak_downloader_from_installer.py` — same core, launched only after Device Installer
- `scripts/atak_imagery_sqlite_builder_finalbuild.py`
- `scripts/atak_dted_downloader.py`
- `scripts/build_tile_plan_cache.py` — optional: precompute per-state tile lists into `data/tile_plans/v1/*.tiles.gz` so downloads skip the slow “scanning tile coverage” step (see `scripts/data/tile_plans/README.md`)
- `scripts/git_update_check.py` — optional startup update offer for git clones (`origin/main`)
- `scripts/tk_window_scaling.py` — scales Tk geometry to the display

Windows-specific build copies:

- `windows_build/atak_downloader_finalbuild_win.py`
- `windows_build/atak_downloader_from_installer_win.py`
- `windows_build/atak_imagery_sqlite_builder_finalbuild_win.py`
- `windows_build/atak_dted_downloader_win.py`

## Critical Project Rule

**Do not treat Linux runtime scripts and Windows EXE scripts as the same thing anymore.**

### Linux / source truth

Linux runtime and source-truth pipeline live in:

```text
scripts/
```
